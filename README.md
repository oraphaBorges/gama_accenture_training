#  Gama Academy + Accenture Training

This repository is a compilation of my notes and exercises from [Gama Academy](https://www.gama.academy/) and [Accenture traning](https://folhadirigida.com.br/mais/noticias/cursos-eventos/gama-academy-bolsas-de-estudo-programacao) for Java, Spring Framework and Angular from 2021 January 18th to February 17th.

## How is this organized?

This is the `eclipse workspace` dedicated to the training and each directory is a different project.

I decide to structure like this, to use it like a notebook for my personal exercises, notes and reviews from things I already studied but never documented before and use it like a portfolio somehow.

So in each project you can find some exercises, notes, mini projects. Everything will be descriped at each README file.

## Projects

### [Java](/java)
In this project you will find the review of basic, intermediary and advanced Java programming and some use cases.
